# Instructions

Below are the instructions for building your own energy panel. Note that these are intended as a guide only. You can and it is recommended to customise the build to your own preferences.

## Materials

The physical components of the build are as follows:

- [IKEA SANNAHED Picture Frame](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/sannahed-frame-black-60459118/)
- A piece of wood (~25cm square) for mounting components to.
- Circuit board stand-offs for mounting

The following electrical components are used:

- Double width solderboard
- Az-Delivery ESP32 Dev Board
- PIR Sensor
- 7-Segment Clock Display (x4)
- 10 LED Bar Display (x2)

Additionally, there are some 3D printed parts for mounting and to neaten the display.

## Physical Build

### Circuit Board

> **TODO**

### Display

The display is built into an [IKEA SANNAHED Picture Frame](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/sannahed-frame-black-60459118/) picture frame, with a pieces of wood holding the display to the front of the frame. This provides ample space behind for the electrical components.

> **TODO: Add images**

I recommend designing your layout first. Remember to plan for where your circuit board will be behind the frame, as you will likely be unable to use this space for any of the displays. The design I used is available at .....

> **TODO: Add images and doc link above**

Once you have a design, you can make cutouts in the wood for your various display components. I opted to 3D print some shrouds for around the displays to hide the edges of the cutouts. If you cut the edges neatly, this can be skipped.

> **TODO: Add images and link to 3D print files**

You may wish to use the perspex sheet provided with the picture frame to improve the finish of the panel. This may require a hole to be made for the PIR sensor to be mounted through. Be careful to avoid cracking the perspex when drilling the hole. It may be best to sandwich the perspex between 2 pieces of wood for drilling.
