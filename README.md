# Energy Panel for Home Assistant

This is a repository contains resources for building a physical energy usage panel, similar to the [Energy Distribution Card in Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/energy/#energy-distribution).

> **TODO: Insert image**

The panel displays:

- Solar energy produced today
- Energy used today within the home
- Energy exported to the grid
- Energy used from the grid
- An indicator of power currently being produced by solar\*
- An indicator of power currently being used or returned to the grid\*

\* These indicators only give an approximation of power being used/produced and do not show a numerical value.
